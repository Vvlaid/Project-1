## Project Description / Outline:

The purpose of this project is to identify heart failure trends within a given 
population. Utilizing historic death rates, age, race, other medical conditions,
and gender. The team will look to predict futuristic trends.

## Research Questions:

- Is Cardiovascular mortality rates trending up or down over the years? 
- Specific country trends?
- Those with underlying medical conditions such as Diabetes or depression are
more likely to have cardiovascular disease.
- Does heart failure have a high mortality rate?
- Does low blood count (RBC, WBC,Platelets), high Cholesterol , High Blood 
- Pressure leads to Heart failure.
- Do we have the same diagnosis and treatment for the same symptoms.
- Compare mortality rates by patients’ gender and residence location? (Urban 
vs. Rural)
- What percent of Heart failure patients have a family history of cardiovascular
conditions?
- Which age group has the highest mortality rate due to smoking?
- Which age group experiences the highest mortality rate?

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
Using Pandas to clean and format your dataset or datasets.

Creating a Jupyter notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup 
process.

Creating a Jupyter notebook illustrating the final data analysis.

Using Matplotlib to create 6 to 8 visualizations of our data (2 visualizations 
per “question” that we ask about our data).

Save PNG images of our visualizations to distribute to the class and 
instructional team—and for inclusion in our presentation.

Creating a write-up summarizing our major findings; this will include a 
heading for each “question” that we ask our data, as well as a short 
description of our findings and any relevant plots.
